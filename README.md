`article.html` is the sample webpage containing keywords in the metadata. Running main.py searches for images with filenames matching the keywords, and if found, copies the ad to be placed on the site.

It can be tested by renaming one or more of the ads present to `news.png`, `lorem.png`, `ipsum.png`, or `lorem ipsum.png`.
